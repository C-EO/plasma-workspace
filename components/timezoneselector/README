## timezones.json

This file is taken from https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases; the 'timezones.geojson.zip' file is chosen as it maps directly to the system available system timezones on Linux. The file is simplified using mapshaper (https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper) to keep it under ~400kb.

The script "timezone_geojson_update.py" automates the download and compress process so that it can be run before any release or upon a timezone change.

## offline_tiles

These tiles are based on the top-most world tile that's available at https://vector.openstreetmap.org/shortbread_v1/0/0/0.mvt, converted to SVG through https://mapbox.github.io/mvt-cruncher/html/mvt2svg.html, replacing the hardcoded red sea color with #AAD3DF; the SVG is then split into sub-tyles using tiles_split.py.
